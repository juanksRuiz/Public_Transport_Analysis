# Public_Transport_Analysis
In this respository, the public transport of Bogota is analyzed in order to identify possible patterns of transport demand of Transmilenio buses which operate in the city as a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. Transport demand is measured every 15 minutes as the number of departures in each bus station.

**Keypoints**:
1. There is a clear cyclic pattern of transport demand during work days (Monday to Friday). The demand of Transmilenio buses changes during weekends as it is expected. Moreover, it reduces drastically when there are protests in the city because of stations are shut down.
2. In order to group stations based on their similarities, hierarchical clustering was used and based on the clustering, 3 group of stations were identified.
